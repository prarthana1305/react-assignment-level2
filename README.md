# Mood Tracker

A React-based Mood Tracker application that allows users to track, delete, and manage their moods. This version introduces advanced features like CRUD operations, undo functionality, and a tabbed interface, with Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features

### 1. Individual Mood Deletion
- Users can delete a single mood entry from the list.
- The UI updates accordingly after a deletion.

### 2. Undo Logic
- Implemented an **Undo** feature that allows users to revert the last deletion or action.
- The app maintains a history of changes, such as the last deleted mood entry, so users can restore it.

### 3. Tabbed Interface
- **Tabs Component**: A simple tab switcher is created to toggle between different views.
  
  **Tabs to Switch Views**:
  - **Mood List Tab**: Displays all mood entries with options to delete or undo actions.
  - **Mood Analytics Tab**: A placeholder view for mood analytics or additional insights (to be expanded further in the next level).
  
- The tabs are styled using **Tailwind CSS**, with smooth transitions and an active state indicator to highlight the active tab.
